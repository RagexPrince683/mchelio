Hello! This file was published to Nexusmods by RagexPrince683.
To get this mod working you need to follow the following steps:
Step 0: have a minecraft account https://www.minecraft.net/en-us
Step 1: ensure you have minecraft forge https://files.minecraftforge.net/
Step 2: click the green code drop down menu on the front page
Step 3: click download as zip
Step 4: extract the zip file
Step 5: ensure the file name is 'mcheli' (ensure that there is an assets and a mcheli folder inside of the folder entitled 'mcheli' otherwise there may be something wrong.)
Step 6: put the main (parent) folder mcheli into the mods folder in your minecraft directory (NOT JUST THE ROOT FOLDER MCHELI you can tell which one is the root foldered mcheli if it has classfiles in it. You want those in your mods folder but you want both assets and mcheli to be subrooted folders.)
Step 7: Install HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod as it is a dependency for this mod. The link for HBM's mod can be found here: https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT NOTICE!!: if you are using an older version of the mod download this hbm version otherwise you will encounter issues (again only if you are using the first version of mchelio): https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27X3920
Step 8: Launch minecraft
