If you already know how to install mcheli please read:
Hello! This is a mcheli pack I stole and tweaked the values for because I just don't care anymore.
If you so happen to have an issue with this please contact me at: ragexprince684@gmail.com
I will absolutely wholeheartedly ignore you because I do not check my emails. Thanks in advance!
To further elaborate on what I would like to see this pack become is something warthunder esque or arma 3 tier for minecraft of course, using mcheli's limitations.
However, free time isn't infinite and this doesn't pay at all, so I highly doubt anything that massive will ever come of this.
