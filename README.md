Hello! This file was uploaded by RagexPrince683 to either Modrinth, Nexusmods, or Curseforge. If there is an update available, you can download it from the following sources:

Curseforge (NEW!): [Download Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcheli-overdrive-loader-mod)

Modrinth: [Download Link](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcheli-o)

Nexusmods: [Download Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/minecraft/mods/375)

Itch.io: [Download Link](https://ragexprince683.itch.io/mcheli-overdrive)

To successfully install and use this mod, follow these steps:



Step 0: Ensure you have a Minecraft account: [Minecraft Account](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us)


Step 1: Make sure you have Minecraft Forge installed: [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)


Step 2: Download the mod from one of the available sources.


Step 3: Extract the downloaded ZIP file.


Step 4: Verify that the extracted folder's name is 'mcheli'. (Ensure there are 'assets' and 'mcheli' folders inside the 'mcheli' folder; otherwise, there might be an issue.)


Step 5: Place the main (parent) 'mcheli' folder into the 'mods' folder within your Minecraft directory. (Note: Do not just place the root 'mcheli' folder there. The root folder is identifiable by having class files. You need those class files in the 'mods' folder, but 'assets' and 'mcheli' should remain as subfolders.)


Step 6: Install HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod as it's a dependency for this mod. You can find the mod here: [HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT) IMPORTANT: If you're using an older version of the mod (1.2 or lower), download the corresponding HBM version to avoid compatibility issues (only necessary for the first version of mcheli-o): [HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod Legacy Version](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27X3920)


Step 7: Launch Minecraft.
