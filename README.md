How to install:


Step 0: have minecraft


Step 1: ensure you have minecraft forge https://files.minecraftforge.net/ 


Step 2: click the green code drop down menu on the front page


Step 3: click download as zip


Step 4: extract the zip file


Step 5: rename the folder 'mchelio-main' to mcheli (ensure that there is an assets and a mcheli folder inside of the folder entitled 'mchelio-main' otherwise there may be something wrong.)


Step 6: put the main (root directory) folder mcheli into the mods folder in your minecraft directory (NOT JUST THE ROOT FOLDER MCHELI you can tell which one is the root foldered mcheli if it has classfiles in it. You want those in your mods folder but you want both assets and mcheli to be subrooted folders.) 


Step 7: Launch minecraft







If you already know how to install and or are a creator for mcheli/mcheli content packs please read:


Hello! This is a mcheli pack I stole and tweaked the values for because I just don't care anymore.
If you so happen to have an issue with this please contact me at: ragexprince684@gmail.com
I will absolutely wholeheartedly ignore you because I do not check my emails. Thanks in advance!
To further elaborate on what I would like to see this pack become is something warthunder esque or arma 3 tier for minecraft of course, using mcheli's limitations.
However, free time isn't infinite and this CERTAINLY doesn't pay at all, so I highly doubt anything that massive will ever come of this.
